# FOTOMATIC-BROKEN

## This is a project from Codecademy where the site was broken and had to be fixed in several places in order to render the way the example was rendering. Several things needed to be added to the HTML, and several CSS rules needed to be revises, particularly in the @media rules.

## To do
Add accessibility features:
<ul>
<li>use semantic tags instead of divs</li>
<li>add alt comments for photos</li>
<li>Add Aria arguments in tags</li>
</ul>
